WebFF
=====

WebFF is an open and extensible molecular dynamics force-field (FF) repository, designed to support the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) for organic and related soft materials. The repository is built using the NIST **Materials Data Curation System (MDCS)** [`link <https://mgi.nist.gov/materials-data-curation-system>`__] which supports ontology based database descriptions using XML schema. 


Features
--------

Here are some of the main features of WebFF:

* Users interact with the repository through two main portals. The **Data Exploration Portal** [`link <https://webff.nist.gov/explore>`__] supports search for force-field data based on the curated metadata descriptors and download in a number for common formats. We will work with the user community to expand output format coverage per user requests.

* The **Data Curation Portal** [`link <https://webff.nist.gov/curate>`__] supports upload of published force-field data with appropriate metadata descriptors to support provenance based data sharing. New datasets may be curated interactively or using a python based toolset to upload large datasets en masse. Data curation requires an authorized account.

* The initial release of the repository features three integrated XML schemas:
	1. Class I organic force-fields in such as OPLS, Amber and CHARMM style representations
	2. Class II style force-fields such as CFF, PCFF, COMPASS and TEAMFF
	3. Coarse-Grained models at various levels of granularity

* For questions, comments and requests please contact: webff@nist.gov 


**If you use data from WebFF in your work, we ask that you please cite the following:**

    1. The main source or the data cited in the XML metadata
